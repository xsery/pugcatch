  "body": "Welcome to the Pugcatch wiki!\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nPugcatch is based on the common videogame concept where the player walks on platform a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. There are over 300 for iOS alone.\r\n\r\nPugcatch creators:\r\n* Francisca Augusto - Developer\r\n* Hanna Pinheiro - Designer\r\n* Irlan Costa - Developer\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\nThe player controls a pug, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the pug continually gets longer as it moves. In another common scheme, the pug puppies has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the pug runs into the screen border, a trail, or another obstacle.\r\n\r\n## ART Concept\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xsery/pug_catch.github.io/master/Layout-3---Banner.png)\r\n\r\n## Sound\r\n\r\nSound effects: Freesound\r\nMain theme: Dogsong - Undertale mixed by the team\r\n\r\n## Play\r\n\r\n[test](export\\)",
